            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>We therefore being inevitably and of abſolute Neceſſity forced to take this laſt Remedy, the Magiſtrates, having ſhut the Door by a Law againſt any Application; That whatſoever, our Grievances either in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or Sacred Matters be, we had not the priviled<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of a Supplicant or Petitioner.</p>
            <p>Do judge our ſelves bound to declame that theſe, with many other horrid grievances in Church and State, which we purpoſe to manifeſt more fully hereafter, are the true Cauſes of this our Lawful and Innocent Self defence.</p>
            <p>And we do moſt ſolemnly in the Preſence of Almighty God, the Searcher of Hearts, declare, that the true Reaſons of our continuing in Arms, are candidly and ſincerely theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Defending and Securing the true Proteſtant Religion, and Presbyterial Government founded on the Word of God, and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily comprehended in our Confeſſion of Faith, and Catechiſms, and eſtabliſhed by the Laws of this Land, to which the King, Nobles and People, are ſolemnly engaged in our National and Solemn League and Covenant.</p>
            <p>And more particularly, the defending and maintaining the kingly Authority of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt over his Church, againſt all ſinful ſupremacy deregatory thereto, and incroching thereupon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The preſerving and defending the Kings Majeſties Perſon and Authority in preſervation and defence of the true Religion of the Kingdom, that the world may bear witneſs with our conſciences of our loyalty that we have no thoughts nor intentions to diminiſh his juſt power and greatneſs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The obtaining of a free and unlimited Parliament and a free General Aſſembly in order to the redreſſing the aforeſaid Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances for preventing the Eminent Danger of Popery and Extirpating Prelacy.</p>
            <p>This therefore being the Cauſe we doe appeare for, and do Reſolve in Gods great name to own, hereby homologating or aſſenting to all the Teſtimonies, of all the Faithful ſufferers for truth in <hi>Scotland</hi> theſe Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years by-gone.</p>
            <p>We humbly requeſt the Kings Majeſty would be pleaſed to reſtore all things as he found them, when God brought him home to his Crown and Kingdoms, and if that cannot be obtained then we heartily and humbly Invite, Intreat, Beſeech and Obteſt in the Bowels of Jeſus Chriſt All who are under the ſame Bonds with us to Concur in the defence of this Common Cauſe and Intereſt, and that they would not ſtand ſtill and

Friends of the Truth diſcouraged, yea the Proteſtant Religion in <hi>Brittane</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> deſtroyed; but even themſelves within a little while made a Prey of, or elſe force when we are broken, (which the good Lord prevent) dreadfully to wrong their own Conſcience.</p>
            <p>Finally becauſe we deſire no mans hurt or blood, we requeſt our Country men now the ſtanding Forces of the Kingdom, ſome of them being our Friends and Kinſmen not to fight againſt us leaſt in ſo doing they be found fighting againſt God, whoſe Cauſe and Quarrel we are ſure he will own and ſignally Countenance, ſeeing we fight under his Banner who is the Lord of Hoſts.</p>
